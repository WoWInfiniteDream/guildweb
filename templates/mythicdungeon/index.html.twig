{% block body %}
Need to build something so that data will be stored in the database every hour or something. <br />
That should allow us to not overuse the Blizz API and it should still give a proper image. <br />
<br />
Once done: It should show all the characters in the guild and the included mythic scores.
Excluding any characters below max lvl and anyone with 0 score.
